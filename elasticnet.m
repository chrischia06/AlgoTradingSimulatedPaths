%ELASTICNET Regularization and variable selection for regression via the
%   Elastic Net.
%
%   BETA = ELASTICNET(X, Y, DELTA) performs Elastic Net [1] regression on
%   the variables in X to approximate the response y. Variables X (n x p)
%   are assumed to be normalized (zero mean, unit length), the response y
%   (n x 1) is assumed to be centered. The regularization parameter DELTA
%   specifies the weight on the L2 penalty on the regression coefficients.
%   A positive value of DELTA makes analyses of p>n datasets possible and
%   encourages grouping of correlated variables. Setting DELTA to zero
%   yields the LASSO solution. BETA contains the Elastic Net solutions for
%   all values of the L1 regularization parameter, starting from a large
%   value corresponding to all beta coefficients equal to zero, to 0,
%   corresponding to the ordinary least squares solution.
%   BETA = ELASTICNET(X, Y, DELTA, STOP) with nonzero STOP yields Elastic
%   Net solutions with early stopping at a particular value of the L1
%   regularization parameter. If STOP is negative, STOP is an integer that
%   determines the desired number of non-zero variables. If STOP is
%   positive, it corresponds to an upper bound on the L1-norm of the BETA
%   coefficients. Setting STOP to zero (default) yields the entire
%   regularization path.
%   BETA = ELASTICNET(X, Y, DELTA, STOP, STOREPATH) with STOREPATH set to
%   true (default) will return the entire regularization path from zero
%   active variables (a high value of delta) to the point where the STOP
%   criterion is met, or the least squares solution in reached when STOP =
%   0. Setting STOREPATH to false will yield the single solution at which
%   the STOP criterion is met, thus saving precious computer resources.
%   BETA = ELASTICNET(X, Y, STOP, STOREPATH, VERBOSE) with VERBOSE set to
%   true (default is false) will print the adding and subtracting of
%   variables as ELASTICNET solutions are found.
%   [BETA INFO] = ELASTICNET(...) returns a structure INFO containing
%   various useful measures. If the entire solution path has been
%   calculated, INFO containts the goodness-of-fit estimates AIC (Akaike's
%   Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), Mallow's
%   Cp statistic, and the number of degrees of freedom at each step. It
%   also includes the L1 penalty constraints s and lambda of which the
%   former represents the size of the L1 constraint defined in the range
%   [0,1], and the latter is lambda in the forumlation beta = arg min ||y
%   - X*beta||^2 + delta*||beta||^2 + lambda*||beta||_1. If stop <> 0
%   and a single Elastic Net solution is returned, INFO will only contain
%   the lambda and s value at the solution along with the number of
%   degrees of freedom. INFO also includes the number of steps made to
%   compute the solution, including the first step where beta is the zero
%   vector.
%
%   The algorithm is a variant of the LARS-EN algorithm [1].
%
%   Example
%   -------
%   Compute the full Elastic Net solution path from a synthetic data set
%   with 40 variables where the model is a linear combination of the first
%   three variables plus noise. Visualize the path, where the the three
%   variables included in the model can be distinguished from the rest.
%
%   % Fix stream of random numbers
%   s1 = RandStream.create('mrg32k3a','Seed', 42);
%   s0 = RandStream.setDefaultStream(s1);
%   % Create data set
%   n = 30; p = 40;
%   correlation = 0.2;
%   Sigma = correlation*ones(p) + (1 - correlation)*eye(p);
%   mu = zeros(p,1);
%   X = mvnrnd(mu, Sigma, n);
%   % Model is lin.comb. of first three variables plus noise
%   y = X(:,1) + X(:,2) + X(:,3) + 0.5*randn(n,1);
%   % Preprocess data
%   X = normalize(X);
%   y = center(y);
%   % Run ELASTICNET
%   delta = 1e-3;
%   [beta info] = elasticnet(X, y, delta, 0, true, true);
%   % Plot results
%   h1 = figure(1);
%   plot(info.s, beta, '.-');
%   xlabel('s'), ylabel('\beta', 'Rotation', 0)
%   % Restore random stream
%   RandStream.setDefaultStream(s0);
